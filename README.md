Ok, this is just a simple script that watches over a directory for changes and filters into folders based on their extension the files that are at the root of the directory being watched.

1. To run the script you have to run npm install 
2. Create a folder in the root of the project named testdir or change baseDir to whatever directory you want to watch and organize.
3. run node index.js
